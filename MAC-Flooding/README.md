# Network Sniffing Attack

## 📌 Overview
This project studies the **Network Sniffing attack**, which involves capturing
and analyzing network traffic in order to understand how data flows across a
network and how unencrypted communication can be exposed.

The project highlights why encryption and proper network segmentation are
critical for protecting sensitive information.
