# Attack Explanation

## Introduction
This document provides a technical explanation of the attack, describing how
it works, why it is effective, and under which conditions it can succeed.

---

## Normal Network Behavior
Under normal conditions, network devices communicate following specific rules
and protocols designed to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Switches, routers, and protocols operate in a way that limits unauthorized
access to traffic.

---

## How the Attack Works
The attacker exploits a weakness or misconfiguration in the network in order
to intercept, manipulate, or redirect traffic.

This attack targets a specific network layer and relies on protocol behavior
rather than software vulnerabilities.

---

## Why the Attack Is Effective
The attack succeeds because:
- Trust is assumed between network devices
- Certain protocols lack authentication
- Security mechanisms are not enabled or misconfigured

---

## Attack Limitations
This attack may fail if:
- Proper security controls are enabled
- Traffic is encrypted
- Network monitoring systems detect abnormal behavior

---

## Conclusion
This attack demonstrates the importance of understanding protocol behavior
and implementing layered security defenses to protect network infrastructure.
