#🔐 Network Attacks Lab

##📌 Overview

This repository contains a collection of network security lab projects focused on studying common Layer 2 and Layer 3 network attacks in a controlled and legal lab environment.
Each attack is implemented and documented as a separate project, followed by a final comprehensive attack chain that demonstrates how multiple attacks can be combined in real-world scenarios.

##🎯 Objectives

Understand how network attacks work at a technical level
Analyze the impact of each attack on network security
Learn how attacks are chained together
Study effective defense and mitigation techniques
Develop hands-on experience using network simulation tools

##🧪 Lab Environment

All experiments were conducted in an isolated lab environment using:
GNS3
Kali Linux (Attacker)
Ubuntu Linux (Victim)
Layer 2 Switch
Router (Gateway)

⚠️ No attacks were performed on real or public networks.
